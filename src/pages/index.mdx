# Cashu is Ecash for Bitcoin {{ className: 'gradientText pb-1 mb-4 font-display text-3xl md:text-5xl tracking-tight max-w-xl' }}

Cashu is a free and open-source Chaumian ecash protocol built for Bitcoin. Ecash is a digital bearer token that is stored on a user's device, very similar to physical cash. The Cashu protocol allows you to build applications such as wallets or voucher systems. Cashu is designed to be private, secure and scalable. Transactions are instant and nearly free. {{ className: 'text-lg md:text-xl break-words max-w-xl' }}

## What is Cashu? {{ id: 'what-is-cashu' }}

Cashu is an ecash protocol that is integrated with the Bitcoin protocol. An Ecash system consists of two parts, the mint and the Ecash wallet. Anyone can run a mint for their application, be it a wallet, a web paywall, paid streaming services, or a voucher and rewards system for a super market. Ecash transactions between users or from the user to a service provider respect the user's privacy. A mint does not store a database of user accounts and their activity which protects users of an Ecash system from leaks their private data to hackers and can provide stronger censorship resistant than classical payment systems.

# Explore Cashu

### Cryptography

Cashu is an Ecash implementation based on [David Wagner's variant](https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/03/msg01848.html) of Chaumian blinding.

### Protocol

Cashu [NUTs](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts) (Notation, Usage, and Terminology) are Cashu's protocol specifications and the developer libraries make it easy to write wallets and mints.

## Apps {{ id: 'apps' }}

There are many apps that implement the Cashu protocol. Apps are available as mobile apps for iOS and Android, progressive web apps (PWA), and command-line tools (CLI).
